# üß¨ Lab2Clinic AI: Advanced Molecular Intelligence Platform 

## [Lab2Clinic App is here](https://lab2clinicai.streamlit.app/)

Lab2Clinic AI is a powerful, enterprise-grade web application built with Streamlit and RDKit, designed to accelerate the early stages of drug discovery. It provides real-time prediction, visualization, and interpretation of molecular properties and safety profiles for novel chemical entities.

Leveraging machine learning models and established chemoinformatics principles, this platform helps researchers quickly assess the efficacy, safety, and developability of potential drug candidates before extensive lab work begins.

‚ú® Key Features
The platform is structured into core modules designed to support the complete preclinical assessment lifecycle:

## 1. MolGenie Lab (Design & Prediction)
Real-time Property Calculation: Calculate essential physicochemical properties (like Molecular Weight, LogP, TPSA, etc.) using RDKit.

Developability Scoring: Instantly generate a composite score to prioritize molecules based on their calculated properties.

Structure Handling: Process molecules directly via SMILES input.

### Supported Design Scenarios (3)

### 1. User enters SMILES and get the detailed Summary
### 2. User enters textual based questions and get the answers from Internal Knowledge base.
### 3. User enteres textual based questions along with SMILES and get (both) answers from knowledge base and detailed summary.

## 2. DrugSafe Platform (Safety & Interpretation)
ML-Powered Safety Analysis: Utilize pre-trained machine learning models (loaded via joblib) to predict key safety and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) endpoints.

Detailed Analysis Visualization: Render complex results, likely including comparison against benchmarks or therapeutic indices.

Interpretability with SHAP: Crucially, the platform integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain why the model made a specific prediction, enhancing trust and providing actionable molecular insights.

Predictive AI Agents (6 Core ADMET/Tox Endpoints)

## 3. Interactive Data Visualization
Utilizes Altair for generating dynamic, high-quality visualizations (e.g., property distributions, score breakdowns, or comparison charts) to quickly communicate complex chemical data.

## 4. Enterprise-Ready UI
Responsive Design: Features a custom CSS setup for optimal viewing across desktop and mobile devices.

Persistent State: Uses Streamlit's st.session_state for seamless navigation and maintaining analysis results across pages.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup
To run the Lab2Clinic AI platform locally, you will need Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a modern version of Python installed.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/YourOrg/lab2clinic-ai.git](https://github.com/YourOrg/lab2clinic-ai.git)
cd lab2clinic-ai


#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
The application relies heavily on cheminformatics and machine learning packages. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv or conda).

Create a virtual environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows


Install the required Python packages:
The following packages are necessary (ensure these are listed in a requirements.txt file for easy installation):

pip install streamlit pandas numpy rdkit-pypi joblib altair shap Pillow


(Note: The actual dependencies should be finalized based on the complete app.py file, but this covers the essential imports.)

#### Step 3: Required Assets
The application depends on pre-trained machine learning models. Ensure the following files are present in your project structure (or a designated models/ directory):

model_file.joblib: The trained ML model for safety/ADMET prediction.

scaler_file.joblib: Any required data pre-processing scalers or encoders.

### üí° Usage
Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Streamlit application from the root directory:

streamlit run app.py


This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Navigation
Start on the MolGenie Lab page (default entry point). Input a molecular structure (SMILES string) here and calculate its fundamental properties.

Navigate to the DrugSafe Platform to submit the molecule for Advanced Analysis. The platform will run the ML model and display the safety predictions along with the SHAP-based explanation.
