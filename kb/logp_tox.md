## Brief
LogP (octanol–water partition coefficient) is a measure of lipophilicity. It strongly influences solubility, permeability, clearance, and toxicity risk.

## Toxicity relationships
- **High LogP (>4–5)**:
  - Increases nonspecific binding to proteins and membranes.
  - Correlates with poor solubility and higher clearance variability.
  - Associated with off-target activity and higher promiscuity.
  - Can raise risk of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) via CYP inhibition.
- **Moderate LogP (1–3)**:
  - Often optimal balance for oral drugs: adequate permeability with manageable solubility.
- **Low LogP (<0)**:
  - May have poor permeability despite good solubility.

## Medicinal chemistry heuristics
- Reduce LogP if a compound shows high clearance, nonspecific toxicity, or solubility issues.
- Check related liabilities: hERG inhibition and CNS penetration risks often rise with lipophilicity.
