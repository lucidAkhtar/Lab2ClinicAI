## Brief

- Short descriptions of common pathway/assay types used in Tox21-style profiling and what their outputs mean for triage.

## Typical assay endpoints

- Estrogen receptor (ER) — measures agonist/antagonist activity on ER. Activation may indicate endocrine activity; interpretation depends on potency and selectivity.

- Androgen receptor (AR) — analogous to ER for androgen signalling; relevant for endocrine-disruption screening.

- Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) — activation can indicate xenobiotic-sensing pathway engagement and downstream transcriptional changes.

- Pregnane X receptor (PXR) — activation suggests potential for induction of metabolizing enzymes and drug–drug interactions.

- Nuclear receptors & stress-response pathways — (NRs, ARE, p53-related assays): pathway-specific biological signals.

## How to read assay outputs

- Many profiling datasets produce normalized activity scores (0–1) or probabilities from models. Score near 1 typically indicates stronger activity; however, each assay/model has its own calibration and false-positive modes.

- Always check assay metadata (plate effects, cytotoxicity cutoffs). A pathway signal concurrent with high cytotoxicity should be interpreted cautiously.
