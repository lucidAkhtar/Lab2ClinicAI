## Brief

- Common structural motifs frequently associated with chemical reactivity or toxicity. This is a heuristics list for triage — not a deterministic rule.

## Frequently-flagged motifs

- Nitroaromatics (–NO2 on aromatic ring)

    - Rationale: can be reduced to reactive amines or nitroso species; often associated with genotoxic/metabolic liabilities.

    - Medicinal note: avoid when possible; if present, confirm by metabolism studies and Ames test.

- Anilines / aromatic amines

    - Rationale: oxidative bioactivation can form reactive intermediates.

    - Medicinal note: consider N-substitution or ring modification to reduce activation.

- Michael acceptors / activated alkenes (α,β-unsaturated carbonyls)

    - Rationale: electrophilic; can covalently modify nucleophilic biomolecules (proteins, DNA).

    - Medicinal note: consider removing or capping electrophilicity; validate with reactivity assays.

- Thioureas / thiocarbamates

    - Rationale: metabolic activation to reactive sulfur species; associated with idiosyncratic toxicity in some series.

- Epoxides / strained three-membered rings

    - Rationale: highly reactive toward nucleophiles; potential for covalent binding.

- Polycyclic planar aromatics

    - Rationale: intercalation/genotoxicity risk in some systems; also poor solubility.

- Reactive halogenated aliphatic groups

    - Rationale: can form reactive intermediates under metabolism, or cause bioaccumulation concerns.

## Practical checks

- If a motif is present, flag for targeted in vitro assays (Ames, covalent-binding screens, reactive metabolite trapping).

- Document any mitigation (bioisostere, N-methylation, ring edits) in the copilot recommendations.
