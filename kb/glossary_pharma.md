## Brief

- Short glossary of common terms used in medicinal chemistry, ADME and safety assessment.

## Terms

- ADME — Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion: the principal pharmacokinetic processes that determine exposure.

- BBBP — Blood–brain barrier penetration; describes a compound's ability to cross into the central nervous system.

- LogP / lipophilicity — Partition coefficient (often expressed as LogP or cLogP). Higher values mean more lipophilic (lipid-soluble) character.

- pKa — Acid/base dissociation constant; impacts ionization state and therefore solubility/permeability.

- TPSA — Topological polar surface area: correlates with permeability and oral absorption.

- P-gp — P-glycoprotein efflux transporter; substrates may be pumped out of cells or the brain.

- CYP isoforms — Liver cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, etc.) responsible for oxidative metabolism and drug–drug interaction risk.

- Toxicophore — A structural motif that is associated with toxicity (reactivity, metabolic activation, mutagenicity, etc.).

- In vitro vs in vivo — in vitro: cell/assay-based data; in vivo: whole-organism (animal) data.

- SMILES — Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System: a compact string describing a molecule's structure.
