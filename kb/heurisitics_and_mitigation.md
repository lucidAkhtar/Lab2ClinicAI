## Brief

- Actionable medicinal chemistry heuristics commonly used to address common property liabilities.

## Typical modifications to consider

- Reduce lipophilicity: replace lipophilic substituents with more polar isosteres, remove nonessential aromatic rings, or introduce polar side chains.

- Improve solubility: add ionizable groups (where appropriate), switch to more polar bioisosteres, or reduce planarity to lower crystal packing.

- Reduce reactivity/toxicity: remove or mask electrophilic groups (Michael acceptors), replace nitro groups, convert anilines to less-activatable motifs.

- Limit CNS exposure: increase TPSA, lower lipophilicity, or add P-gp substrate-like motifs if brain penetration is undesired.

- Reduce metabolic liabilities: block metabolic hotspots (deuteration, small substitutions) or remove bulky exposed lipophilic surfaces that invite oxidative metabolism.

## Practical workflow

- Prioritize minimal edits for SAR continuity.

- Re-evaluate predicted ADMET/TOX metrics iteratively after each edit.

- Confirm with targeted in vitro assays before downstream investment.
