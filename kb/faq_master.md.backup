A: Add ionizable groups, reduce aromatic planarity, or introduce polar atoms.  
*Source: solubility.md, heuristics_and_mitigation.md*

**Q8: Why does lipophilicity reduce solubility?**  
A: Lipophilic compounds prefer lipid phases over water, reducing aqueous solubility.  
*Source: solubility.md, logp_tox.md*

### BBBP
**Q10: What does BBBP stand for?**  
A: Blood–Brain Barrier Penetration — a measure of CNS access.

**Q11: What TPSA range supports BBB penetration?**  
A: TPSA < 90 Å² generally favors penetration.  
*Source: bbbp.md*

**Q12: How can I reduce BBB penetration if unwanted?**  
A: Increase polarity, reduce LogP, or design as a P-gp substrate.  
*Source: bbbp.md, heuristics_and_mitigation.md*

**Q13: Why is P-gp important for BBB predictions?**  
A: P-gp efflux pumps substrates out of the brain, reducing penetration.

### LogP and toxicity
**Q14: Why is high LogP a risk for toxicity?**  
A: LogP >4–5 increases nonspecific binding, solubility issues, and off-target activity.  
*Source: logp_tox.md*

**Q15: What LogP range is often desirable for oral drugs?**  
A: Around 1–3 balances permeability and solubility.  
*Source: logp_tox.md, admet_interpretation.md*

**Q16: Can very low LogP be a liability?**  
A: Yes — LogP <0 often results in poor permeability despite good solubility.

### Toxophores
**Q17: Why are nitroaromatics risky?**  
A: They can form reactive metabolites associated with genotoxicity.  
*Source: toxophores_common.md*

**Q18: What is a Michael acceptor and why avoid it?**  
A: An α,β-unsaturated carbonyl; it’s electrophilic and can covalently bind biomolecules.  
*Source: toxophores_common.md*

**Q19: Why are anilines considered problematic?**  
A: They may undergo oxidative bioactivation to toxic intermediates.  
*Source: toxophores_common.md*

**Q20: What’s the issue with thioureas?**  
A: They can form reactive sulfur species linked with idiosyncratic toxicity.  
*Source: toxophores_common.md*

### Assays
**Q21: What does ER assay activation mean?**  
A: It suggests estrogen receptor agonism or antagonism — possible endocrine disruption.  
*Source: assay_descriptions.md*

**Q22: Why is PXR activation significant?**  
A: It indicates risk of drug–drug interactions through enzyme induction.  
*Source: assay_descriptions.md*

**Q23: What does AhR activation mean?**  
A: Engagement of xenobiotic pathways with potential downstream transcriptional changes.  
*Source: assay_descriptions.md*

**Q24: Why should cytotoxicity be checked with pathway signals?**  
A: A pathway hit with high cytotoxicity may be an artifact, not a true effect.  
*Source: assay_descriptions.md*

### ADMET interpretation
**Q25: What does a high developability score mean?**  
A: It suggests favorable solubility, LogP, and clearance profile relative to others.  
*Source: admet_interpretation.md, howtos_admet_score.md*

**Q26: What does low solubility imply in practice?**  
A: Likely poor oral absorption and formulation challenges.  
*Source: solubility.md, admet_interpretation.md*

**Q27: What does high BBBP prediction imply?**  
A: Strong CNS penetration — good for brain drugs, a liability for others.  
*Source: bbbp.md, admet_interpretation.md*

**Q28: Why is TPSA important?**  
A: It predicts passive permeability — high TPSA reduces oral absorption.  
*Source: admet_interpretation.md*

### Model scope and limitations
**Q29: Can these models predict dose-dependent toxicity?**  
A: No — they provide intrinsic property predictions, not dose–response effects.  
*Source: model_scope_and_limitations.md*

**Q30: Do predictions account for metabolites?**  
A: No — metabolism and species-specific effects are not fully modeled.  
*Source: model_scope_and_limitations.md*

**Q31: Are large peptides or metal complexes covered?**  
A: They fall outside the model’s training domain and predictions may be unreliable.  
*Source: model_scope_and_limitations.md*

### Practical heuristics
**Q32: How do I reduce lipophilicity?**  
A: Use polar isosteres, remove aromatic rings, or add polar groups.  
*Source: heuristics_and_mitigation.md*

**Q33: How can I reduce metabolic liabilities?**  
A: Block metabolic hotspots or deuterate labile positions.  
*Source: heuristics_and_mitigation.md*

**Q34: How to lower CNS penetration?**

### How-to workflows
**Q38: How should I use the developability score?**  
A: For ranking compounds within a series, not as an absolute decision.  
*Source: howtos_admet_score.md*

**Q39: What steps should I take if a compound is flagged unsafe?**  
A: Inspect Tox21 pathways, SHAP drivers, and toxicophore presence.

**Q40: How to iteratively improve a compound flagged by ADMET?**  
A: Make minimal edits, rescore properties, and validate experimentally.
