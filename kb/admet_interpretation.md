## Brief

- What common ADMET numbers mean in practice and simple rules-of-thumb used during early discovery triage.

## Key metrics and pragmatic interpretation

- Solubility — low aqueous solubility reduces oral exposure and complicates formulation. Rule-of-thumb: improved solubility is usually sought when experimental or predicted solubility is very low; relative thresholds depend on assay (kinetic vs thermodynamic).

- LogP / lipophilicity — higher lipophilicity generally correlates with lower solubility, higher clearance variability, and higher off-target binding. Typical discovery target window: approx. 0–3 (context-dependent). Values above ~4–5 often trigger a lipophilicity risk flag.

- BBBP (brain penetration) — if brain activity is undesirable, predicted high BBBP is a liability; if CNS exposure is desired, it’s a positive.

- TPSA — high TPSA often correlates with poor passive permeability; values > 140 Å² typically indicate poor oral absorption for small molecules.

- Developability / composite scores — these aggregate multiple properties (solubility, lipophilicity, clearance risk, synthetic tractability). Use them as an index for triage rather than an absolute decision.

## Caveats

- Predictions are model-dependent. Use the composite/developability score to rank compounds within a series rather than to make stand-alone go/no-go calls.
