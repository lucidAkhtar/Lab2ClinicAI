## Brief

- How to interpret the composite developability score

- Understand inputs: check which properties feed the score (solubility, logP, clearance risk, synthetic complexity).

- Rank not decide: use the score to rank analogues for follow-up assays, not to make absolute go/no-go calls.

- Inspect drivers: always inspect top drivers (which property contributed most to a p)
