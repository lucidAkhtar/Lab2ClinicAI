## Brief

- Short paraphrased summaries of representative literature you can extend later. These are placeholders — add full references/DOIs in a citations/ folder when available.

- Paper A — Lipophilicity and DDI risk: summary: higher lipophilicity correlates with increased off-target binding and clearance variability in several compound series.

- Paper B — Nitroaromatic liabilities: summary: nitroaromatic reduction pathways produce reactive metabolites associated with genotoxicity in historical datasets.

- Paper C — Tox21 assay use-cases: summary: pathway-level profiling can identify endocrine disruptor signals that warrant follow-up in orthogonal assays.
