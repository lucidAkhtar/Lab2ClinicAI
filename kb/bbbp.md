## Brief
Blood–Brain Barrier Penetration (BBBP) reflects a compound’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and reach the central nervous system (CNS).

## Key points
- **Desirable** for CNS-targeted drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antiepileptics).
- **Undesirable** for peripherally acting drugs (e.g., antihistamines without sedation).
- **Physicochemical correlates**:
  - Lipophilicity (LogP ~2–4) supports penetration.
  - Low polar surface area (TPSA < 90 Å²) favors penetration.
  - Low molecular weight (< 450 Da) increases likelihood.
- **Transporter effects**:
  - P-gp substrates may be actively effluxed, lowering CNS penetration.
- **Models**: BBBP predictors usually output a binary class (penetrant/non-penetrant) or probability.

## Practical use
- If high BBBP is predicted and CNS exposure is not desired → consider modifications:
  - Increase polarity or TPSA.
  - Reduce lipophilicity.
  - Design in P-gp substrate motifs.
