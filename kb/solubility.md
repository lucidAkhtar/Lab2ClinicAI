## Brief
Solubility is the maximum concentration of a compound that can dissolve in a given solvent (typically water) under defined conditions. It is a key determinant of oral bioavailability and formulation feasibility.

## Key points
- **Low solubility** can cause poor oral absorption and erratic exposure.
- **High solubility** does not always mean good developability — it must be balanced with permeability and stability.
- **Rule of thumb thresholds**:
  - Kinetic solubility < 10 µM → often considered poor for oral drug candidates.
  - Kinetic solubility > 100 µM → usually considered acceptable for early screening.
- **Molecular drivers**:
  - High lipophilicity → usually reduces solubility.
  - Planar aromatic stacking and high crystallinity lower solubility.
  - Polar functional groups and ionizable centers generally improve solubility.

## Mitigation strategies
- Add ionizable groups (acidic or basic).
- Reduce aromatic surface area or planarity.
- Introduce heteroatoms to increase polarity.
- Explore salt formation or amorphous formulations at later stages.
